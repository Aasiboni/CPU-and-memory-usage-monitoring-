The program regularly monitors CPU & memory usage and sends alerts to the selected email if usage is higher than what we set.

The user needs to set some parameters:
* load_limit - Check if usage has crossed this threshold and will be sent an email if yes.
* interval_time - The parameter specifies the range of time we check that we did not cross the line we set
* sender_address = An email address from which the alert will be sent
* sender_pass = The email address password from which the alert is sent
* receiver_address = The addresses to which the alert will be sent.
